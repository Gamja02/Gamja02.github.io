    <h1>Weekend Shortcut</h1>
    <h4>#MobileApp #UXUI</h4>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>I diligently followed step-by-step design best practices, incorporating recorded sessions of UX/UI Pathway to grasp the team's work style effectively. I was able to design a mobile app, tackling the everyday pain point of planning day trips.</p>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>To familiarize myself with the team's work style, enabling me to address the pain point of day trip planning and design wireframes and mockups for a mobile app solution.</p>

            <h2>The Pain Point</h2>
            <h4>Planning day trips to be a bit of a hassle. We get it – the current process can be a real buzzkill.</h4>
            <p>Current approaches to planning day trips often lack efficiency, leading to a time-consuming and frustrating process, particularly when individuals are uncertain about destinations, timings, and transportation. The effort required to gather all this information and plan accordingly can quickly become exhausting.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <h4>Don’t spend too much time on planning. Let Weekend Shortcut curate your perfect day trip, from destinations to schedules, so you can focus on making memories, not itineraries.</h4>
            <p>I addressed the challenge of inefficient day trip planning by creating an app that offers personalized recommendations based on user preferences. The app streamlines the process by generating comprehensive schedules, complete with departure times, transportation durations, and optimal time allocations at each destination.</p>

                <p>21 | Pursuing bachelor’s degree | Nashville, TN | Intern</p>
                <h1>“New place, new things to try out”</h1>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>To have a memorable time with peer interns during the summer.</li>
                    <li>Love activities in general and want to spend time in the nature.</li>
                    <li>To efficiently plan the weekend getaway ahead so that I can communicate with other interns in easier way.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Pain Points</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not familiar to new city and what’s available nearby</li>
                    <li>Always feel lack of time planning and organizing weekend events</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I flew all the way from Nashville, TN to Redlands, CA for the summer internship. I want to make the most out of this experience, including both professional and personal life. Esri’s university team helps me succeed as an intern but I also want to have a enjoyable time with other interns outside of work. I love activities that always bike to work and usually go to hiking during weekends. Since I’m here, I want to try something new that I couldn’t have done in my hometown.</p>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <h4>Why the task fail?</h4>
    <p>There are more than one pain point when Stephanie tries to plan and go for a weekend getaway with her fellow interns. One of them is a lack of time to plan things out and communicate. From here, I decided to help them save time by providing recommendations and a schedule.</p>
    <img src="/Post/WeekendShortcut/Image/WSIdeation1.png">
    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <p>The user journey is simple. Once the user chooses a recommended place or event, they will be prompted with several questions that will eventually help build a personalized schedule.</p>

    <img src="/Post/WeekendShortcut/Image/WSlowfi.png">
    <h4>Trying different ways to convey multiple time information</h4>
    <p>Multiple time information should be provided on the schedule page: 1) Departure and arrival time 2) Time spent on the place 3) Transportation time. To intuitively convey these information, I tried different ways.</p>

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <h4>Started as a side project during the internship, but has more potential.</h4>
            <p>Weekend Shortcut started as a side project while I was taking the UX/UI Pathway during my internship. However, the concept has the potential to address various pain points beyond the ones previously described. For instance, it could be adapted as a conference or event app, offering recommendations and a comprehensive schedule for the day. This schedule could include event durations, estimated walking times, and start and end times. I am considering creating additional mockups tailored for these purposes to further explore the application of Weekend Shortcut.</p>
